In This project we will learn sorting,
specifically bubble sort of N number of terms.


Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through lists that need to be sorted,
comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
This passing procedure is repeated until no swaps are required, 
indicating that the list is sorted.Bubble sort gets its name because smaller elements bubble toward the top of the list.


So basically In this code we have to 
1. enter the number of elements to be sorted.
2. enter the element.
3. the sorting process starts .
4. and the final output is displayed on the screen.
